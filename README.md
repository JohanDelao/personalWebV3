Third version of my website!

Reasoning behind a <strong>THIRD</strong> website: 
<li>My first website was simplistic however design wise I felt was clunky and a little bit aged</li>
<li>My second website was more sophisiticated but I think maybe a little too much. I'm not sure but I did not like the look, I enjoyed making it though</li>
<li>This website feels like a middleground between the two and I enjoy the aesthetic of it. Simple and looks good with enough info!</li>
